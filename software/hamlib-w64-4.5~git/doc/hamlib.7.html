<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hamlib - radio
and rotator control library</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>Ham
Radio Control Libraries</b>, <b>Hamlib</b> for short, is a
development effort to provide a consistent interface for
programmers wanting to incorporate radio and rotator control
in their programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hamlib is not a
complete user application, rather, it is a software layer
intended to make controlling various radios and other
amateur radio station (shack) hardware much easier. Hamlib
will allow authors of software such as logging programs,
digital communications programs, or those wanting to develop
the ultimate radio control software to concentrate on the
user interface and the basic function of the program rather
than radio control. Hamlib consists of several parts, the
programming library, utility programs, and library
interfaces to other programming languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most recent
amateur radio transceivers allow external control of their
functions through a serial interface. Unfortunately, control
commands are not always consistent across a
manufacturer&rsquo;s product line and each
manufacturer&rsquo;s product line differs greatly from its
competitors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hamlib attempts
to solve this problem by presenting a <i>virtual radio</i>
to the programmer by providing an interface to actions such
as setting a given Variable Frequency Oscillator&rsquo;s
(VFO) frequency, setting the operating mode, querying the
radio of its current status and settings, and giving the
application a list of a given radio&rsquo;s capabilities.
Unfortunately, what can be accomplished by Hamlib is limited
by the radios themselves and some offer very limited
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other devices,
such as antenna rotators, can be placed into the Hamlib
control scheme. Other recent developments include network
interface servers and a USB interface capability. Language
bindings are provided for <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>Perl</b>,
<b>Python</b>, <b>Lua</b> and <b>TCL</b> (more to come).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Overview</b>
<br>
Hamlib is a <i>front end</i> library providing a <b>C</b>
language Application Programming Interface (API) to
programmers wishing to integrate radio or rotator control in
their applications. Hamlib presents a <i>virtual radio</i>
or <i>virtual rotator</i> that is a consistent interface to
an application despite wide differences in radio and rotator
interfaces and capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The front end
library uses a number of <i>back end</i> libraries to
translate from the front end to the various individual radio
and rotator models. A back end library handles conversion of
the front end variables to the format needed by the radio or
rotator device it controls. The back end libraries are
generally grouped by manufacturer and in some cases by a
common control protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hamlib also
provides an interface library for each of several common
<i>scripting</i> languages such as
<a href="http://www.perl.org"><b>Perl</b></a>,
<a href="http://www.python.org"><b>Python</b></a>,
<a href="https://www.lua.org"><b>Lua</b></a>, and
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk"><b>TCL</b></a>. These language
<i>bindings</i> are generated through the use of
<a href="http://www.swig.org"><b>SWIG</b></a>, a
parser/generator for multiple language interfaces to a
<b>C</b> library. A natively generated <b>C++</b> language
interface is also provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Besides the C
and supplemental APIs, Hamlib also provides a pair of
network daemons that provide a text command based API for
controlling an attached radio or rotator through a
<b>TCP</b>/<b>IP</b> network connection. The daemons then
handle the interface to the Hamlib C API.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More than one
type of device, radio or rotator, may be controlled at a
time, however, there is generally a limit of one device per
serial port or other port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Hamlib
project information</b> <br>
The Hamlib Project was founded by Frank Singleton,
VK3FCS/KM5WS in July 2000. Shortly after Stephane Fillod,
F8CFE, joined Frank on the Hamlib project and the API and
implementation development led to a reasonable level of
maturity in a few years. A major milestone was reached when
Hamlib 1.2.0 was released in March 2004. The API and
Application Binary Interface (ABI) interfaces have remained
stable since that time up to the release of 3.3 in mid 2018.
Version 4.0 marks a major change to the ABI and certain
changes to the API.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Development
continues through the major version number 4.<i>x</i> series
and beyond. The 4.0 release marks a major change in the ABI
with several changes for additional modes and such that will
require client programs that use the C ABI to be
recompiled/relinked, etc. Other goals include improving the
overall documentation (this man page with more in progress),
and other updates as warranted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Project is
hosted by
<a href="https://sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</a> at the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/">Hamlib
project page</a>. As <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
has become a very popular project hosting site, Hamlib also
has a dedicated
<a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib">GitHub project
page</a>. GitHub also hosts the
<a href="http://www.hamlib.org">hamlib.org</a> Web site and
the <a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/wiki">Hamlib
Wiki</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Development
discussion and most user support take place on the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hamlib/mailman/">hamlib-developer
mailing list</a>. While there are
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hamlib/discussion/">SourceForge.net
discussion forums</a>, they are rarely used and not as
closely read by the developers as the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For <i>source
code management</i>, the project uses
<a href="http://git-scm.com/"><b>Git</b></a>, a fast,
distributed content tracker. Among its features is that
every developer has the complete Hamlib development history
available locally. For more information on using Git, see
<b>hamlib-git</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note</b>:
while a canonical Git repository is hosted at SourceForge,
its availability is not essential to continued development
although development work flows would change temporarily.
Several developers find the GitHub Web interface easier to
use and lately development has centered around GitHub rather
than SourceForge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Applications
using Hamlib</b> <br>
A number of application developers have taken advantage of
Hamlib&rsquo;s capabilities to implement radio and/or
rotator control. While not exhaustive, a list is maintained
at the Hamlib Wiki,
<a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/wiki/Applications-and-Screen-Shots">Applications/Screenshots</a>.
Developers are encouraged to request their applications be
added to the gallery by way of the hamlib-developer mailing
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using Hamlib
with your program</b> <br>
As with other Free Software projects, Hamlib relies heavily
on copyleft licensing to encourage development contributions
and provide an open atmosphere for development.
Hamlib&rsquo;s source code is released under two licenses,
the <b>Lesser General Public License</b> (LGPL) version 2.1
for the library portion, and the <b>General Public
License</b> (GPL) version 2 for the utility programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The LGPL allows
the library to be used (linked) by programs regardless of
their individual license. However, any contributions to the
library source remain under a copyleft license which means
that the library source code may not be used in violation of
the terms of the LGPL (see the file <b>COPYING.LIB</b> in
the main source directory). Concepts learned by studying
these sources for the purpose of understanding the Hamlib
API is not covered nor prohibited by the LGPL, however,
directly copying LGPL sources into any work that is
incompatible with the terms of the LGPL is a violation of
the terms of the license.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The utility
program source files are released under the GPL. Any direct
use of these sources must be in a form that complies with
the terms of the GPL (see the file <b>COPYING</b> in the
main source directory). Concepts learned by studying these
sources for the purpose of understanding the Hamlib API is
not covered nor prohibited by the GPL, however, directly
copying GPL sources into any work that is incompatible with
the terms of the GPL is a violation of the terms of the
license.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Radios with
a clone capability</b> <br>
Hamlib&rsquo;s focus is on controlling radios that employ a
port and command protocol for setting frequency, mode, VFO,
PTT, etc. Most VHF/UHF transceivers do not employ such
control capability but do provide for cloning the memory
contents from radio to another of the same model. A related
project,
<a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com"><b>Chirp</b></a>, aims
to support radios with such a clone capability. Please
contact the Chirp project for support of such radios.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pronouncing
Hamlib</b> <br>
English speakers seem to have two alternate pronunciations
for our project:</p>

have people who say Linux &ldquo;L-eye-nux&rdquo; and those
who say &ldquo;L-in-nux&rdquo;...</p>
